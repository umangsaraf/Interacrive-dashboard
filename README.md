Some of the limatation I encountered - 
- I wasnt able to sync the price to the legend
- I was having problem syncing together the first 3 charts since all of them were in diffrent div containers early 
- Getting the ngative to go below the area chart. I was able to do it when i switched from arespline to area but it then messed 
up all the postive values 
- Get a box chart next to the pie chart
